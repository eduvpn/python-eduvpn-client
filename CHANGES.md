4.1.0 (2023-04-18)
==
Changes since 4.0.1:

* Update internal API to use eduvpn-common 1.1.0
    - Fixes OAuth issues with version 2 servers (empty refresh tokens on getting new tokens with a refresh token), fixes #521
    - Makes sure tokens are kept in sync between client and lib with a callback
    - Secure Internet: The default home location is chosen on adding
* Sort profiles and locations in CLI and UI, fixes #523
* Failover: The procedure that tries to detect issues with UDP connectivity
    - Support failover for OpenVPN, fixes #519
    - If failover was unable to determine connectivity issues but it took longer than normal (meaning: after the 2 second timeout where we try to get a pong from the server), a "reconnect with TCP" button is shown in the UI. For the CLI a --tcp flag is added, fixes #519
    - Use the first available IP in the subnet for the WireGuard gateway, for OpenVPN we request the gateway IP from NetworkManager
* CLI
    - Various fixes with regards to connecting, e.g. supplying an organisation ID previously resulted in an error
    - Clarify in flags help when a server is added fresh
    - Hide change location in Let's Connect!
* Misc
    - Hide the connection validity text when connecting
    - Be sure the renew session button is hidden when not connected
    - Update issues URL to link to the Linux client repo instead of eduvpn-common
    - Update desktop files with the correct name, fixes #522

Fixes
--------

* #426 - A renew session button is shown with accordance to the eduVPN specification https://github.com/eduvpn/documentation/blob/v3/API.md#session-expiry
* #412 - Prehashed signatures are supported because we use the official minisign go library in the eduvpn-common codebase
* #405 - The CLI now works correctly and should be more user friendly, especially if the interactive mode is used
* #374 - Let's Connect! now also has a CLI
* #351 - No longer a warning should be shown
