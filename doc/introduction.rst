Introduction
============

This is the GNU/Linux desktop client and Python API for eduVPN. The Desktop client only works on Linux, but most parts
of the API are usable on other platforms also. Python 3.6+ is required.

Installation
============

It is recommended to use a package to install the eduVPN client, but you can also install using pip from py or directly

 * Debian 10 (Buster)
 * Ubuntu 20.04 LTS & 18.04 LTS
 * CentOS 8
 * Fedora 32

.. note::

    If you target is not supported the client might still work with limited functionality. You need to have
